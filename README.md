# VLSI- CP, SAT, SMT and MIP Model

This repository contains a project realized as part of the Combinatorial Decision Making and Optimization course exam of the Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence, University of Bologna.

VLSI, which stands for Very Large Scale Integration, involves the process of incorporating electronic circuits onto tiny silicon chips. The challenge in VLSI design revolves around arranging these circuits on a limited-sized chip efficiently. This entails working with a fixed-width chip and a set of rectangular circuits, and the objective is to find the optimal arrangement that minimizes the overall length of the final device. Reducing the device's length is important as it enhances its portability. Various problem-solving techniques, such as Constraint Programming (CP), Boolean Satisfiability (SAT), and Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT), have been developed to address this optimization challenge.
